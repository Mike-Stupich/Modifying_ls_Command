# Modifying_ls_Command
Worked with Mat Schmid to create two new arguments for the Linux ls command; -M and --depth.
The -M command will display the contents of the current directory, as well as the files and folders to a depth of 2, in an easily readable format. The --depth command allows the user modify how many levels of depth they would like to view.
Full documentation can be found <a href="https://github.com/Mike-Stupich/Modifying_ls_Command/blob/master/Project%20Report.pdf">here</a>
